> The core development was completed over a two-week period with a friend.

## How to contribute

> [!CAUTION]
> Create a new branch just for you!!

> [!CAUTION]
> The code was developed on wsl 2, as a result I recommend running the code on a linux based system.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After successfully cloning the project:

```bash
# Step 1.1 - create a virtual env
python -m venv env  # venv called `env`
```
```bash
# Step 1.2 - activate virtual env
source env/bin/activate
```
```bash
# Step 2 - intall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run

```bash
# Step 3 - run the code
python3 main.py
```
